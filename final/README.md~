# Record Player - Rotisserie

## Dev Environment

`open host.command`

## Requirements

### Summary:
 A record player that allows you to switch
songs. This will incorporate many background elements
that will react dynamically to different sound and song
changes. We will incorporate the Spotify API to interact
with our project.

### Advanced Topics:
● Shadows of clouds/floating objects in the view
● Collision of the record needle with the center of
the record at song end
● Use morph targets to animate objects in the background
● Possible post processing effects
● Bump mapping
● Moving the arm of the record player to change where you are in the track
